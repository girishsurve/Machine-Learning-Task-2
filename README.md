Project: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
In this project, I implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their annual income and spending score. The goal was to segment customers into distinct groups to enable more targeted marketing strategies.

🔍 Key Features:
• Performed data preprocessing and visual exploration
• Applied K-Means Clustering for unsupervised learning
• Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
• Visualized customer segments for business insights
